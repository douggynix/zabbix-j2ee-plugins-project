This project aims to create Zabbix Plugins for Zabbix Open Source Monitoring systems to monitor specific J2EE Application Servers like Weblogic, JBOSS, Tomcat. We'll also take time a log4j appender for Zabbix which will be able to push errors like Java Exceptions to Zabbix Servers in Active Monitoring Mode.

So, Any Network infrastructure whose applications are managed by J2EE enabled software, can add those plugins to Zabbix to monitor internal state of applications besides Systems health.
